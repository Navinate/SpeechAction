# SpeechAction

This is a simple mod that adds the ability to say keywords to perform emotes.  

Right now you can say "dance" or "party" to perform the dance emote or you can say "point" or "there" (less reliable) to perform the point emote.

> The mod uses Unity's built in UnityEngine.Windows.Speech library for keyword speech detection.

Please feel free to request/pull any other actions, keywords, or features on github.
